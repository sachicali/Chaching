# Documentation and Memory Bank Strategy: Chaching Financial Management Application

## Documentation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Documentation as Code - Living, versioned, and essential infrastructure  
**Purpose**: Ensure project continuity across memory resets and team changes  
**Standard**: Every feature, decision, and pattern must be documented immediately  
**Integration**: Documentation updates are integral to the Definition of Done
