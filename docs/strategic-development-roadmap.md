## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Database Migration Complexity
**Risk**: Data loss during migration from in-memory to persistent storage  
**Impact**: High - Loss of development progress and test data  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement comprehensive backup strategy
- Create migration scripts with rollback capability
- Test migration process in isolated environment
- Maintain parallel data systems during transition

#### 2. Authentication Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Breaking existing client context and state management  
**Impact**: High - Major refactoring required  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement authentication alongside existing context system
- Gradual migration of state management to authenticated model
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing of context integration

#### 3. AI Performance with Real Data
**Risk**: AI flows perform poorly with production data volumes  
**Impact**: Medium - User experience degradation  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- Implement caching strategies for AI responses
- Add fallback mechanisms for AI service unavailability
- Monitor and optimize AI response times

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 4. Currency API Reliability
**Risk**: Exchange rate API service disruption or rate limiting  
**Impact**: Medium - Inaccurate currency conversions  
**Probability**: Low  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement multiple currency API providers
- Cache exchange rates with reasonable TTL
- Fallback to last known rates during API outages
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting

#### 5. Philippines Tax Regulation Complexity
**Risk**: Incorrect tax calculations due to complex regulations  
**Impact**: High - Financial compliance issues for users  
**Probability**: Low  
**Mitigation**:
- Consult with Philippines tax professionals
- Implement conservative tax estimation
- Add disclaimers about professional tax advice
- Regular updates for tax regulation changes
